 I started my schooling as the majority did in my area, at the local primarry school. I then  went to the local secondarry school and recieved grades in English, Maths, Phisics,  Biology, Geography, Art, Graphical Comunication and Philosophy of Religeon. I'll not  bore you with the 'A' levels and above.  Notice the ambigous English qualification above.  It was, in truth, a cource dedicated to  reading "Lord of the flies" and other gems , and a weak atempt  at getting us to  commprehend them. Luckilly my middle-class  upbringing gave me a head start as I was  already aquainted with that sort of langauge  these books used (and not just the Peter and  Jane books) and had read simillar books before.  I will never be able to put that paticular  course down as much as I desire to because , for all its faults, it introduced me to  Steinbeck, Malkovich and the wonders of Lenny, mice and pockets.  My education never included one iota of grammar. Lynn Truss points out in "Eats,  shoots and leaves" that many people were excused from the rigours  of learning English  grammar during their schooling over the last 30 or so years because the majority or  decision-makers decided one  day that it might hinder im agination and expresion (so  what, I ask, happened to all those expresive  and imaginative people before the ruling?)
